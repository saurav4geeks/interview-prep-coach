## Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 | **Role-specific tracks** | Backend (DSA → LLD → HLD), Frontend (DSA in JS/TS → React → FSD), or Fullstack |
| 📅 | **Adaptive daily sessions** | Brief → real LeetCode problem → hint ladder → silent auto-log |
| 🪜 | **5-step hint ladder** | Nudge → Direction → Pattern reveal → Walkthrough → Full reveal + timed rewrite |
| 📊 | **Bi-weekly assessments** | Timed, hint-free mock on Days 14/28/42/56 — scores feed back into the plan |
| 📁 | **Autonomous tracking** | Claude reads/writes your local files directly — no connectors, no paste steps |
| 🔁 | **Spaced repetition** | Weak topics resurface 3–5 days later with fresh same-pattern problems |
| 📈 | **SDE1 / SDE2 / SDE3 leveling** | Difficulty adapts to your target; promotes/demotes on assessment scores |
| ⏰ | **Proactive pings** | Cowork Scheduled Task fires your daily brief at your chosen time |

## Quick start

### 1 — Install the skill

Download [`interview-prep-coach.skill`](https://github.com/saurav4geeks/interview-prep-coach/releases) and install via **Settings → Skills → Install from file**.

### 2 — Open a Cowork project

Create or open any project (e.g. "Prep").

### 3 — Run setup

```
start prep
```

Claude asks 4 questions (role, target level, timeline, daily time) and bootstraps your `Interview-Prep/` folder.

### 4 — Daily sessions

```
brief me
```

Or set up a Scheduled Task so your brief fires automatically each morning.

## Tracking files

Claude reads and writes these files directly at session end — no connectors required:

```
Interview-Prep/
├── tracker.csv          # date-mapped sessions: status, time, problem, rating, notes
├── progress.md          # streak, completion %, level, weak areas, next-up
├── mastery.md           # per-topic confidence: new → building → solid → mastered
└── weekly-reviews.md    # weekend debrief entries
```

## Target bar

**Backend (SDE-2):** LeetCode mediums fluently + hards with hints · 45-min HLD with tradeoffs · Clean LLD with SOLID · Thinking out loud.

**Frontend (mid-level):** Mediums in JS/TS · Event loop, closures, React reconciliation cold · 45-min FSD with component architecture + performance tradeoffs · Accessible component APIs.

**Fullstack:** Meet both bars — identify which side is being tested per round and bring the right depth.
